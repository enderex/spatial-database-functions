* STFindSegmentByMeasureRange -> Support CicularStrings.

* STDensify

Issues to Look at

* STAddPoint (CircularString)
* STBearing in STPointBisector

* STAddPoint vs STAppend

'geometry::Point' failed because parameter 1 is not allowed to be null.

* Support for Reversed Measure in LRS Functions.

* STParallel (not buffer)
* Use STParallel for offet in ByMeasureRange/ByLengthRange.

* Start/End linestring tests for STOneSidedBuffer

STComputeLengthToMidPoint - Supports Measuring arc length from 1st to 3rd or 2nd to 3rd point

* All calculations of deflection angles using STSubtendedAngle

* STDeletePart - Delete high level part of multilinestring or multipolygon cf STExtract
