In order to protect the package from netnannies in corporations rejecting the zip because it 
contains executable cmd tools, I have renamed all the CMD scripts by replacing the "." with an "_".

So, once you have downloaded and unzipped the archive, rename the following:

install_cmd to install.cmd 

Then run the install.cmd to create the schema and load the packages.

Happy SQL Server Spatialling...
